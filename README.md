World of Warcraft Combat Log Parser


This program was written for my final project in my Object Oriented
Programming class at Delaware Tech. The program takes a WoW combat 
log in the form of a CSV text file, and graphically outputs damage 
done. The results are colored, sorted by player name / class, with
damage output displayed in a bar graph.
